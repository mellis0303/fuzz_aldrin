## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Real Contract Analysis**: The system fetches actual bytecode from the blockchain and performs genuine security analysis, not simulated results.

2. **Automated Processing**: The aggregator automatically detects audit requests, processes them, and submits results without manual intervention.

3. **On-Chain Results**: All audit results are permanently stored on the blockchain with verifiable transaction hashes.

4. **Production Ready**: The system handles real contracts, real transactions, and provides actionable security insights.

## Technical Implementation

The system uses:
- Go-based aggregator with concurrent task processing
- Real bytecode analysis for vulnerability detection
- Ethereum event monitoring and transaction submission
- SimpleContractAudit for streamlined audit requests
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

This demonstrates a fully functional AVS that provides real value by performing automated security audits of smart contracts.
